                  yards.
                  Leagues, districts or associations participating in the state competition program that are unable to
                  provide
                  a field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will

                  Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the
                  minimum
                  dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide
                  an
                  acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.
